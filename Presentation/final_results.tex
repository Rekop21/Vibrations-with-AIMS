\section{Objective}

Objective for this project was to produce ionization spectrum with vibrations for complex molecule using computational methods and more specifically FHI-AIMS.

\section{Methods}

There's three main steps in finding the vibrational spectra: finding equilibrium geometry, vibrational frequencies and calculating overlap integrals.

\subsection{Equilibrium geometry}

To find equilibrium geometry molecules were relaxed with FHI-AIMS using keyword \lstinline{relax_geometry}. Calculations were also done for molecules in exited electronic state. To accomplish this keyword \lstinline{force_occupation_projector} was used. Really tight second tier settings were used for atoms and PBE was used as a functional.

\subsection{Vibrational frequencies}

Vibrational frequencies and corresponding reduced masses were calculated with script provided in FHI-AIMS utilities. Previously found equilibrium geometry was used as a base geometry, but otherwise input files were unchanged.

\subsection{Overlap integrals}

Calculating the overlap integral follows closely methods used by Gallandi and K\"orzd\"orfer \cite{gall2015}. If potential surfaces are approximated as harmonic potentials, integral can be calculated in form
\begin{align}
    & \mathrm{FCI}(n_i, n'_i)^2 = e^{-S_i}S_i^{n'_i-n_I} \frac{n_i!}{n'_i!}Â \left[L_{n_i}^{n'_i-n_i}(S_i)\right]^2 \nonumber \\
    & S_i = \delta_i^2 \mu_i f_i/2\hbar \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\mu_i$ is reduced mass corresponding to frequency $f_i$. There is two values for each $\mu_i$ and $f_i$, one for the initial state and one for the final state. Values for the final state, which in this case is the exited electronic state, were used. $\delta_i$ is obtained by first finding the separation between initial and final geometry, then transforming that separation from cartesian coordinates to vibrational normal mode coordinates, and then taking the component $i$. $n$ and $n'$ are lists of vibrational quantum numbers for initial and final state. Every mode for which $S_i < S_min$ is dropped out as irrelevant. Intensity of delta peaks can then be calculated with equation
\begin{align}
    \mathrm{I}(n, n') &= \prod_{i=0}^p \;
    {\overbrace{\textstyle \mathrm{FCI}(n_i, n'_i)^2}^{\mathclap{\text{Overlap integral}}}} \;
    {\underbrace{\textstyle \exp\left( \frac{-\hbar n_i f_i}{k_B T} \right)}_{\mathclap{\text{Temperature term}}}} \nonumber 
\end{align}
where $p$ is a set of relevant modes. Intensity calculation is then repeated for all combinations of $n$ and $n'$ where $\sum_{i=0}^p n_i < A$ and $\sum_{i=0}^p n'_i < B$. With intensities calculated, peak energies are obtained by adding vibrational energy to the peak without vibrations. Vibrational energy can be calculated with $$E_{vib} = \sum_{i=0}^p \left[h f_i(n_i + 1/2)\right]$$ 
The peaks without vibrations were calculated using $G_0W_0$. In the case of benzene there's also peaks calculated with DCI. All the vibrational calculations and by extension vibrational energies used only PBE.

\section{Results}

Usually every electronic transition has around $10-100$ vibrational peaks that have a relative intensity of $0.001$ or more, when the largest peak is in the range $0.5-1.0$. As an example in the Table 1 there's vibrational peaks for one of the benzenes ionizations and in the Figure 1 same peaks plotted.

In the Figure 2 is the ionization spectra the of benzene with ten first transitions. From top to bottom, experimental, $\text{G}_0\text{W}_0$@PBE without vibrations, and $\text{G}_0\text{W}_0$@PBE with vibrations. In the Figure 3 is the same spectra, but with DCI values and only fife first transitions.
